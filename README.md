This is a project from Unit 4 of 5 of Codecademy's Front-End Developer Career Path. The purpose is to practice writing fast, complete, reliable, isolated, maintainable, and expressive test suites using JavaScript
Mocha, describe-it blocks, Node assertions, and phases of a good test (setup, exercise, verify, and teardown).

I wrote the test suite in index_test.js using Mocha test framework and assert methods from the Node.js standard library.

Thank you for your support! Feel free to check in as I continue to build my developer skills.
