This is a project from Unit 4 of 5 of Codecademy's Front-End Developer Career Path. The point of the project is to practice writing fast, complete, reliable, isolated, maintainable, and expressive test suite. 

I wrote the test suite in index_test.js within the test directory using the Mocha test framework and assert methods from the Node.js standard library.

Thank you for your support! Feel free to check in as I continue to build my developer skills.
